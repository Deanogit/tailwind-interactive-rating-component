## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Finally I've begun to get my head around seperating concerns when writing my JavaScript code.

I normally get in such a muddle trying to do too many things at once with functions and quickly I get muddled with the logic flow.

So I'm happy to have found a working solution to this challenge, which I have attempted a few times in the past.

I'm super glad I have persevered and got through this!
